  I am going to develop a tiny application which can do 
some demo for the banker's algorithm. That is why we are 
here. 
  First, Let's take a look at the banker's algorithm:
  The Banker's algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm developed by Edsger Dijkstra that tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes a "s-state" check to test for possible deadlock conditions for all other pending activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue. -----text from Wiki
  TO DO : design the whole process
          design the data structure
          design the mutli-thread condition
          design the critical section
